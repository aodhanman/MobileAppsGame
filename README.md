Vertical scroling shooter in Unity


This is a Unity 2D Vertical Space Shooter game. The object of the game is to get as high a score as possible. You get points by shooting enemies and obstacles. Weak enemies can be destroyed with one shot, bigger enemies like bosses require multiple shots. The player gets 10 points for destroying obstacles, enemies are worth 100 points, bosses are worth 500. 

Bosses move slower but do twice as much damage as basic enemies. The player goes to the next level when they destroy the boss of that level. Levels get progressively harder as the player progresses by increasing spawn frequency and shot frequency.
